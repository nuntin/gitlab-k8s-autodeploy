This is a fully working **GitLab CI/CD + Kubernetes deployment lab** using:

- 🧱 GitLab CI to automate deployment steps
- 🐳 Minikube to simulate a Kubernetes cluster
- 🪖 Helm chart to manage app deployment
- 🔐 Secrets, env-specific overrides, and demo GIF

> You can test everything **locally**, even with **no GitLab Runner**.

## 💡 Why This Exists

Because not every DevOps engineer has:
- Access to paid runners
- Real client jobs to showcase

This project proves you can build + deploy K8s apps **from scratch**.

> It’s not about perfect infra.
> It’s about real infrastructure skill.
