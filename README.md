# GitLab CI Auto Deploy to Kubernetes (Helm + Minikube Example)

> Real-world DevOps Portfolio Lab – Deploy static app to K8s using Helm, GitLab CI, and Minikube. No runners needed.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This is a fully working **GitLab CI/CD + Kubernetes deployment lab** using:

- 🧱 GitLab CI to automate deployment steps
- 🐳 Minikube to simulate a Kubernetes cluster
- 🪖 Helm chart to manage app deployment
- 🔐 Secrets, env-specific overrides, and demo GIF

> You can test everything **locally**, even with **no GitLab Runner**.

## 👀 Who This Is For

✅ DevOps engineers building their portfolio  
✅ Job seekers without access to real infrastructure  
✅ Anyone learning GitLab CI + K8s + Helm from scratch  
✅ Students, bootcampers, freelancers, and survival-mode builders

## 💡 Why This Exists

Because not every DevOps engineer has:
- Access to paid runners
- Real client jobs to showcase

This project proves you can build + deploy K8s apps **from scratch**.

> It’s not about perfect infra.
> It’s about real infrastructure skill.
